Atari Image File Reader

The Atari Image-file Reader-Writer (AIR) public domain project is a collection of programs 
that demonstrate how to read or write several of the Atari Image file formats. The source 
of the programs can be used as a reasonable example if you need to read or write image files. 
While reading or writing the image file the program displays a lot of information about the 
internal content of the file. It should be used in conjunction with the image file format 
description that I also provide.

The programs have a nice WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Graphical User Interface and are developed in C#. 

Currently the AIR project is composed of
- Pasti File format Reader-Writer 
- IPF File format Reader-Writer
